                <p>
                    LedgerCTRL cuts development times down drastically, allowing developers with zero blockchain knowledge to build blockchain-based apps.
                </p>
                <h3 style={{marginTop: 42, marginBottom: 21}}>Mission Statement</h3>
LedgerCTRL was founded with the goal of building and sharing tools that enable developers and technological professionals alike to utilize complex technologies in a straightforward way. We strive to provide systems which operate according to a strict standard of quality, integrity, performance, and most prominently, ease of use.

LedgerCTRL designs systems that are robust enough for production use, but still simple enough for off-hand developments. We believe that by designing a base layer of software which is peer-reviewed and auditable, we provide a stable, trustworthy infrastructure on which truly innovative technology and business can be built.

<h3 style={{marginTop: 42, marginBottom: 21}}>Team Values</h3>
<h5>Learning</h5>
<p>
Aim to learn every day and give due consideration to alternative trains of thought. Learning is most essential in our tech-driven world which changes so quickly. LedgerCTRL values education and experience very highly because we cannot truly solve problems until we find a solution for ourselves.
</p>

<h5>
Self-Motivation &amp; Risk-Taking</h5>
<p>
We believe that anything can be accomplished with the proper research, resources, and people. We also know that there’s no good way to do something that’s never been done before. There will always be situations in which you’re not sure what to do, but regardless of what you do, you should learn from the outcome. Always embrace new situations and learn from the experience to ensure that you’ll be prepared when it happens again.
</p>

<h5>
Exploration, Cross-Training
</h5>
<p>
Having a diverse skillset translates to having more to offer in unfamiliar situations, not to mention that overtraining can lead to stagnant performance. Having experience and/or knowledge in a field unrelated to your primary work often yields unique and innovative ideas.
</p>

<h5>
Ownership &amp; Responsibility
</h5>
<p>
We believe that good work comes from a place of pride. By contributing to the LedgerCTRL project, you are taking on responsibility for your contribution, and by publishing your work with your name next to ours, you become a part of the team. Those who contribute to the project significantly deserve to be recognized for their work. All contributors to the LedgerCTRL project will be publicly recognized by the LedgerCTRL company, and those who go the extra mile will be wholeheartedly compensated.
</p>

<h5>
Integrity &amp; Trust
</h5>
<p>
Team members are expected to put their best foot forward and act with full honesty and impartial judgement. Team members are entrusted with responsibility for their portion of the project, and are expected to use all tools at their disposal to ensure that nothing less than the best work possible is contributed.
</p>

<h5>
Transparency
</h5>
<p>
As an open-source project, it is our constant goal to have every measure in place so that we can effectively create innovative solutions, and efficiently mitigate unwanted outcomes. We always take appropriate measures to produce elegant, effective, and powerful tools which can be trusted in production environments.
</p>

<h5>
Balance
</h5>
<p>
Everything is good in moderation. As important as work may be, we know that life isn’t about work. Life is meant to be enjoyed, which is why we encourage all team members to take the extra time to do things that contribute to their happiness and wellbeing.
</p>

<h5>
Responsibility &amp; Societal Impact
</h5>
<p>
As creators, it is our responsibility to ensure that our products don’t create more problems than they solve. We create software to improve the reliability and effectiveness of blockchain implementations, and we must consistently ensure that our efforts meet that end. We take responsibility for our actions and we own what we create.
